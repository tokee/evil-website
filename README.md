# evil-website
A HTTP server intended for testing web harvesting

## Motivation
Web harvesting and web archive discovery encounter all kinds of things in the wild.

This project aims to serve as a testbed for web archive tools by presenting both edge cases and violations of the different standards.

## General thoughts
Maybe the webserver should be able to run in 2 modes:

* Standard-compliant: Right a the edge of the standards
* Everything-goes: Try to crash harvesters and indexers even when it violates the standards

## Status
Only at the idea stage: Check the issue tracker
